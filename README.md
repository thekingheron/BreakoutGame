## Introduction

Breakout is a classic arcade game originally developed by Atari in 1976. The objective of the game is to break all the bricks on the screen using a ball and a paddle. The player controls the paddle horizontally, bouncing the ball to break the bricks. If the player misses the ball with the paddle, they lose a life. The game continues until all lives are lost.
